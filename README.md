This dataset is a collection of more than 30,000 Donald Trump tweets, dating from 2009 to 2016.

The columns of the data file are:

* Text — full message posted on Twitter,
* Date — date when Twitter message was posted,
* Favorites — number of times Twitter message was marked as favorite by the other users,
* Retweets — number of times Twitter message was re-posted or shared by the other users,
* Tweet ID — ID of Twitter message.


We will use this dataset to create a word-level text generator using a pretrained architecture.
